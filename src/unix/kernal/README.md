# What is an operating system? 
An operating system consists of a *Kernel* and some system programs. Software does not need a kernal to run on computer hardware. The Kernel is it self a program, that manages the computers hardware and and software. In high performance cases engineers often write software that is intened to run directly on computer hardware without the use of a kernel. Kernels can however dramaticly the ease of application development and boost security, but at the cost of processor tmie and memory. All Desktop computers as well as Many game consoles, media players, and Internot of Things (IoT) devicses have operating systems. 

System programs are software executed by the kernal. Systems programs ususaly make up the functionality a quazi cares about. An quazi will most likely be unaware of the kernal even though system programs depend on the kernal to run. On a desktop computer system programs are often tools for reading and manipulating files, or reading and writing data from an to the network. System programs often get more CPU time and are allocated more memory that the Kernel. The kernal should simply do its various jobs allowing a quazi to read, write, and execute software with ease.
